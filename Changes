Revision history for HTML-LinkList
==================================

0.07 Thu 02 February 2006
-------------------------

  * (2 Feb 2006) depth fixes
  	- enabled start_depth and end_depth to be changed for nav_tree
  without wierdness happening.  It used to be that end_depth was ignored,
  and if start_depth was anything other than 1, one would get too many links.

  * (25 Jan 2006) empty lists
  	Added a check to see that the generated list wasn't empty;
  before this, it would *always* put on the list_head and list_foot
  stuff even if there was nothing there.  Which meant that you
  could end up with something like <ul></ul> which is Not Nice.

  * (25 Jan 2006) parent_item_sep
  	Added the 'parent_item_sep' parameter to 'nav_bar'.
